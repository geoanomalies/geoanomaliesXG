title: Call for Papers
---

The workshop seeks high-quality full (8-10 pages) and short (4 pages) papers that have not been published in other academic outlets and are not concurrently under peer review. Once accepted, at least one author is required to register for the workshop and the ACM SIGSPATIAL conference, as well as attend the workshop to present the accepted work which will then appear in the ACM Digital Library. As GeoAnomalies papers appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL proceedings we follow the same submission process. Following the main-conference, we also allow full papers to have a two-page appendix beyond the ten pages limit.



We accept papers addressing the issues related to, but not limited to, these topics: 

- Theoretical Foundations of Geospatial Anomaly Detection	
    - Mathematical Models for Anomaly Detection
    - Information Theory for Anomaly Detection
    - Uncertainty Modeling
- Machine Learning for Geospatial Anomaly Detection
    - Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-supervised Techniques
    - Discriminative Models
    - Generative Models
- Statistical Models for Geospatial Anomaly Detection
    - Parametric and Non-Parametric Methods
    - Hypothesis testing for Anomaly Detection
- Complex Network Analysis
- Spatio-Temporal Modeling
    - Temporal Dynamics and Time Series Analysis
    - Spatio-Temporal Statistical Models
    - Modeling Spatio-Temporal Data Streams
- Case Studies and Real-world Applications for Anomaly Detection on Spatial Data
    - Urban Planning and Traffic Anomaly Detection
    - Disaster Response and Public Safety
    - Human Behavior Anomaly Detection
- Benchmarking and Evaluation
    - Datasets/Metrics for Geospatial Anomaly Detection
    - Comparative Studies

**Important Dates:** 

- Paper Submission: ~~August 9, 2025~~ <strong style="color:#BE3455;">August 29, 2025</strong>
- Decisions to Authors: September 26, 2025
- Camera-Ready: October 10, 2025


**Author Guidelines**

Accepted GeoAnomalies'25 papers will appear in the ACM SIGSPATIAL'25 Proceedings. Therefore, we follow the same formatting requirements as ACM SIGSPATIAL'25 which can be found [ACM SIGSPATIAL Website](https://sigspatial2025.sigspatial.org/).<br>

Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available on [ACM Template Website](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).<br>

SIGSPATIAL uses the Conference Proceedings Primary Article template with two-column format. Alterations to the template, especially to gain more space, will be grounds for administrative rejection without further technical review. Submissions to ACM SIGSPATIAL are single-blind -- i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version. The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.
